Monster Remote (gem: monster_remote)
====================================

#What is this?
A gem to help you publish your [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog via
ftp (or any other "plugable" remote machine connection provider).

#How is this?
After install the gem

    gem install monster_remote

A new executable is gonna be at your service: `monster_remote`.

##Syncing
Enter the jekyll blog root path and type:

    monster_remote [--ftp] -s 'your_server_address' -u 'your_user_here'

The --ftp option is default, you could create you own connection
provider if you need it.

You will be prompted for your password. To reduce the size of the
command by configuring some of these informations on your jekyll
configuration file:

    monster:
      remote:
        host: xpto.com
        user: omg_my_user

Monster will rely on this configurations if you execute it without -s
and -u params like this:

  monster_remote

##Filtering specific files
A filter is an object which `respond_to? :filter`, you can stack
filters within of the synchronization execution. The code to do that
has to stay on a `monster_config.rb`, create this file on the root
directory of your jekyll site:

```ruby
# monster_config.rb

Monster::Remote::add_filter(my_filter)
```

`monster_remote` is shipped with a "name_based_filter", if you want to
reject specific files or directories based on the name, you could do
something like these:

```ruby
# monster_config.rb

my_filter = Monster::Remote::Filters::NameBasedFilter.new
my_filter.reject /^.*rc/
my_filter.reject /^not_allowed_dir\//

Monster::Remote::add_filter(my_filter)
```

The above example will reject any file starting with a "." and ending
with "rc", wich is pretty much any "classic" configuration file that you
have on your directory. Neither "not_allowed_dir" gonna be synced. You
could provide an array if you prefer:

```ruby
my_filter.reject [/^.*rc/, /Ë†not_allowed_dir\//]`
```

Or you could use a string:

```ruby
my_filter.reject ".my_secret_file"
```

If you need execute more specific or complex logic, you could use a "raw
filter". Just provides a block with the logic you need, an array with
the dir structure will be passed as argument and a filtered array should
be returned. Just files and dirs on the result array will be synced:

```ruby
my_custom_filter = Monster::Remote::Filters::Filter.new
my_custom_filter.reject lambda { |entries|
  # do whatever you need here, for example:
  entries.reject do |entry|
    entry =~ /^.*rc/ || entry =~ /^not_allowed_dir\//
  end
}

Monster::Remote::add_filter(my_custom_filter)
```
